        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>Is Trust powered by AI?</h3>
        <p>No. Trust is built by humans — students, educators, and researchers who care about source quality and clarity.</p>

        <h3>How do you decide what's trustworthy?</h3>
        <p>We look at source reliability, factual consistency, author background, and cross-checks with academic and journalistic standards.</p>

        <h3>Can I submit a source for review?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Just send it to <a href="mailto:contact@blacklink.net">contact@blacklink.net</a> and our team will review it manually.</p>

        <p>
          Blacklink Education is an independent student-founded company on a mission to make digital learning better — not just flashier. We build tools students actually want to use (like <b>Trust</b>), and we believe education tech should be as intuitive as TikTok but as reliable as a textbook.

        <p>
          From school networks to AI-free source checks, we focus on real-world problems students face every day — and we build solutions from the inside out.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're based in the U.S., but powered by students and educators across the world. Want to partner, suggest a feature, or just say hey? Email us at <a href="mailto:contact@blacklink.net">contact@blacklink.net</a>.
